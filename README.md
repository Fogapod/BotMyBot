Bot is currently in early stage of development, but it's already usable and has several useful commands.

You can add bot to your guild [with administrator permision](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=394793577160376320&scope=bot&permissions=8) or [without administrator permission](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=394793577160376320&scope=bot&permissions=2146958583)

Bot is developed by me (Eugene#3778), feel free to join development guild to ask help / questions: https://discord.gg/TNXn8R7  
Default prefix is `+`, you can also mention bot to use command.  
Use `help` command to get list of available commands.

You can run bot with `bash run.sh` file from root directory.  
Requirements:
